# Admin Customers Page - Real Database Integration

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What Was Changed:

#### 1. **Added Database Function** (`lib/userProfile.js`)
Created `getAllCustomers()` function that:
- Fetches all users with role='customer' from database
- Includes customer details: email, name, phone, location, stats
- Gets last booking date for each customer
- Orders by most recent customers first

```javascript
export const getAllCustomers = async () => {
  // Fetches customers from database
  // Includes booking statistics
  // Returns formatted customer data
}
```

#### 2. **Updated Admin Customers Page** (`app/admin/customers/page.jsx`)
Replaced hardcoded data with real database queries:
- Fetches customers on component mount
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Handles errors with retry option
- Calculates stats from real data
- Implements search functionality
- Displays data in grid or table view

## 🔍 Search Functionality

Search filters customers by:

- Phone number

Case-insensitive matching.

---

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Component Loads
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchCustomers() // Calls getAllCustomers() from API
}, [])
```

### 2. Data Fetching
```javascript
const result = await getAllCustomers()
// Returns: { success: true, customers: [...] }
```

### 3. Stats Calculation
```javascript
const totalRevenue = customers.reduce((sum, c) => sum + (c.total_spent || 0), 0)
const avgBookings = totalBookings / totalCustomers
```

### 4. Display
- Shows loading spinner while fetching
- Displays stats cards with real numbers
- Renders customer cards/table with real data
- Filters based on search query

---

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

## 📝 Notes

### Currency Format
- Changed from $ to ₱ (Philippine Peso)
- Uses `.toLocaleString()` for number formatting

### Performance
- Fetches all customers at once (consider pagination for large datasets)
- Last booking date fetched per customer (consider optimization if slow)

### Future Enhancements
- Add pagination (if >100 customers)
- Add sorting by columns
- Add export to CSV functionality
- Add customer detail modal/page
- Add filters (by status, date range, etc.)
- Add customer activity timeline
- Cache data to reduce API calls

# 45-Day Payment Policy

## Overview
This document explains the automatic cancellation policy for bookings with remaining balance that are less than 45 days before travel.

## Policy Summary

**Key Rule:** Bookings with unpaid remaining balance MUST be paid at least 45 days before the check-in date. If not paid by this deadline, the booking will be **automatically cancelled** and is **non-refundable**.

### Why This Policy?

1. **Planning & Logistics** - Gives the travel company enough time to finalize arrangements
2. **Vendor Commitments** - Many hotels and services require payment 45+ days in advance
3. **Inventory Management** - Allows time to re-sell slots if customer doesn't complete payment
4. **Customer Commitment** - Ensures serious bookings, reducing last-minute cancellations

## Payment Options

### Full Payment (100%)
- Customer pays entire amount at booking
- ‚úÖ No risk of auto-cancellation
- Booking confirmed immediately after admin approval

### Partial Payment (50%)
- Available ONLY for bookings 45+ days before travel
- Customer pays 50% at booking
- Remaining 50% must be paid before reaching 45-day deadline
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of auto-cancellation if balance not paid in time

## Implementation

### Customer Dashboard

**1. Payment Status Indicators**

When customer views their bookings, they see:

```jsx
// Green badge - Fully paid, no action needed
‚úÖ Paid

// Orange badge - Partial payment made
‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Payment

// With days remaining indicator
üìÖ 46 days until travel - Pay by Jan 1
```

**2. Warning Banner (< 45 days)**

If booking has remaining balance and is within 45 days:

```jsx
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ ‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Deadline Passed                      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                                                  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ This booking is less than 45 days before travel ‚îÇ
‚îÇ (44 days remaining). Payment can no longer be   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ processed. This booking will be automatically   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ cancelled and is non-refundable.                ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

[Payment Unavailable] ‚Üê Disabled button
```

**3. Pay Remaining Balance Button**

```jsx
// Available (> 45 days before travel)
[üí≥ Pay Remaining Balance] ‚Üê Active, clickable

// Unavailable (< 45 days before travel)
[üí≥ Payment Unavailable] ‚Üê Disabled, greyed out
```

### Auto-Cancellation System

**Function:** `autoCancelExpiredBookings()`
**Location:** `lib/bookings.js`
**Triggers:** Runs automatically when user loads dashboard

**Logic:**
```javascript
1. Find bookings where:
   - Status: 'pending' or 'confirmed'
   - remaining_balance > 0
   - check_in_date <= (today + 45 days)

2. For each booking found:
   - Update status to 'cancelled'
   - If was 'confirmed', restore the package deal slot
   - Log cancellation
   - (Future: Send email notification)

3. Return results:
   - Number of bookings cancelled
   - List of affected customers
```

### Payment Validation

When customer clicks "Pay Remaining Balance":

```javascript
const handlePayNow = async (booking) => {
  // Calculate days until trip
  const checkInDate = new Date(booking.check_in_date)
  const today = new Date()
  const daysUntilTrip = Math.ceil((checkInDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))

  // Block payment if < 45 days
  if (daysUntilTrip < 45) {
    alert(
      `This booking cannot be paid as it is less than 45 days before travel ` +
      `(${daysUntilTrip} days remaining).\n\n` +
      `According to our policy, bookings with remaining balance must be paid ` +
      `at least 45 days before travel.\n\n` +
      `This booking will be automatically cancelled and is non-refundable.`
    )
    window.location.reload() // Refresh to show cancellation
    return
  }

  // Proceed with PayMongo checkout
  // ...
}
```

## Database Schema

### bookings table
```sql
- check_in_date: DATE (travel start date)
- remaining_balance: DECIMAL (unpaid amount)
- status: ENUM ('pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled', 'completed')
- payment_status: ENUM ('pending', 'partial', 'paid')
```

### Key Query
Find bookings at risk:
```sql
SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.booking_number,
  b.customer_first_name,
  b.customer_email,
  b.check_in_date,
  b.remaining_balance,
  b.status,
  (b.check_in_date - CURRENT_DATE) as days_until_travel
FROM bookings b
WHERE 
  b.status IN ('pending', 'confirmed')
  AND b.remaining_balance > 0
  AND b.check_in_date <= (CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '45 days')
ORDER BY b.check_in_date ASC;
```
